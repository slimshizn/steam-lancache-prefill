Automatically fills a [Lancache](https://lancache.net/) with games from Steam, so that subsequent downloads for the same content will be served from the Lancache, improving speeds and reducing load on your internet connection.

# Installation

**SteamPrefill** is flexible and portable, and supports multiple platforms and configurations. It can be run directly on the Lancache server itself, or on your gaming machine as an alternative Steam client. You should decide which one works better for your use case.

Detailed setup guides are available for the following platforms:

# Getting Started

## Selecting what to prefill

> [!WARNING]
> This guide was written with Linux in mind. If you are running **SteamPrefill** on Windows you will need to substitute `./SteamPrefill` with `.\SteamPrefill.exe` instead.

Prior to prefilling for the first time, you will have to decide which apps should be prefilled. This will be done using an interactive menu, for selecting what to prefill from all of your currently owned apps. To display the interactive menu, run the following command

```powershell
./SteamPrefill select-apps
```

Once logged into Steam, all of your currently owned apps will be displayed for selection. Navigating using the arrow keys, select any apps that you are interested in prefilling with **space**. Once you are satisfied with your selections, save them with **enter**.

<img src="docs/img/svg/Interactive-App-Selection.svg" alt="Interactive app selection">

These selections will be saved permanently, and can be freely updated at any time by simply rerunning `select-apps` again at any time.

## Initial prefill

Now that a prefill app list has been created, we can now move onto our initial prefill run by using

```powershell
./SteamPrefill prefill
```

The `prefill` command will automatically pickup the prefill app list, and begin downloading each app. During the initial run, it is likely that the Lancache is empty, so download speeds should be expected to be around your internet line speed (in the below example, a 300mbit/s connection was used). Once the prefill has completed, the Lancache should be fully ready to serve clients cached data.

<img src="docs/img/svg/Initial-Prefill.svg" alt="Initial Prefill">

## Updating previously prefilled apps

Updating any previously prefilled apps can be done by simply re-running the `prefill` command, which will use same prefill app list as before.

**SteamPrefill** keeps track of which version of each app was previously prefilled, and will only re-download if there is a newer version of the app available. Any apps that are currently up to date, will simply be skipped. The number of apps already up to date will be displayed in the end of run summary table:

<img src="docs/img/svg/Prefill-Up-To-Date.svg" alt="Prefilled app up to date">

However, if there is a newer version of an app that is available, then **SteamPrefill** will re-download the app. Due to how Lancache works, this subsequent run should complete much faster than the initial prefill (example below used a 10gbit connection).
Any data that was previously downloaded, will be retrieved from the Lancache, while any new data from the update will be retrieved from the internet. Any apps that have been updated will be counted towards the "Updated" column in the end of run summary.
